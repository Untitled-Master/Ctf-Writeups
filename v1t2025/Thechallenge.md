<!-- If your renderer doesn't like spaces in file names use the HTML form below:
<img src="Pasted image 20251102201037.png" alt="Pasted image 20251102201037" />
-->

The challenge has no title, no description and only an empty file  
After downloading it and opening it, you can find a pattern

<!-- <img src="Pasted image 20251102201218.png" alt="Pasted image 20251102201218" /> -->

This is a file that uses WhiteSpace  
Decoding it would give you the flag
